                                    <p> In sync with Singapore's pursuit for a Smart Nation, the Asia's best digital bank, DBS introduced mobile wallet PayLah! to faciliate the convenience and ease of payments. In a short span of a couple of years, PayLah! is widely available at many merchants. More distinctly, many hawker centers offer scanning of PayLah!'s QR code as a form of convenient transaction. <br>
                                    <br> Acknowledging that millennials are the initial target audience for this new form of payment, DBS has been rigorously active in encouraging adoption and usage of PayLah! at tertiary institutions like the National University of Singapore. </p>

								<p> Prior to being a user of DBS PayLah!, I had used Venmo mobile application during my stint in the US. Unlike PayLah!, Venmo does not belong to any bank and that means that regardless of who you bank with, as long as you have an American bank account connected to venmo, you have access to Venmo. This feature allowed Venmo to reach out to a wide base of American users and Venmo eventually became a popular method of peer-to-peer payment. In fact, the app was so widely used that people started using "venmo" as a verb. Another fun feature of Venmo is the recommendation of emojis that is aligned with the word of phrase input. Venmo users are also able to see a list of peer-to-peer transactions within user's own social circle or even a global one. There is also no maximum sum for transaction. <br><br>
                                On my return from the US, DBS PayLah! became more popular and has received a wide adoption around NUS campus. As a user of PayLah! for almost a year now, the application really did make transaction seamless and hassle-free. It is perfect for someone like me who hates touching germs-filled cash. Now, I use PayLah! to pay for every meal in campus. The incentive of having $0.20 cheaper when this payment mode was used, encouraged more people around me to use the app. <br><br>
                                
                                When it comes to being a consumer of technology, I would consider myself to be an early adopter and in some cases, an innovator and I have no qualms about adopting technology. However, where fintech is concerned, security and privacy is no doubt a cause for concern. To encourage ease of use, the 2 factor authentication was removed for good but it also makes the app more vulnerable to hackers. While I have yet to seen any repercussion for poor security and privacy, PayLah! should address this two matters through educating consumers that their concern is void. <br><br>
                                    
                                Using Touch ID to access the PayLah! application helps improve user-friendliness and reduce lag time in opening the app for payments. Even so, the application takes a fair amount of time to load and open and quite frequently, using PayLah! for payment holds up the queue. This is ironic because the mobile wallet was designed to function as a quicker and hassle-free payment mode. Since we can attribute this slow Internet connection to 4G, the true value of integrating fintech into our daily lives can be extracted when technology advancement permits. The introduction of 5G in the coming years will definitely help in changing consumer behaviour as more people in Singapore adopt PayLah! or equivalent mobile wallets as a new form of payment.

								<h5>Bill Splitting</h5>
								<p>One key payment behaviour of PayLah!'s main target audience, the millennials of Singapore is that they love to share food. When dining out with a group of friends, bill splitting is always a hassle especially for those who detest calculations. <br><br> Introducing bill splitting as a feature will enable users to easily split bills among friends, facilitating ease of payment. How can this be done? When one person from the group scans the QR code using PayLah! there could be a function to enable bill splitting among a stipulated number of friends. The app will then calculate the each user's bill based on the number of diners input. This calculation is based on the assumption of equal individual payment. However, in many scenarios, this is not the case. More sophisticated bill splitting includes each person paying different amount based on what they had ordered, with just a simple QR code scan. Although this could be negated when merchants churn out individual receipts, it will take up time and create hassle. Hence, a more in-depth method of bill splitting will be extremely useful for PayLah's main target audience who loves dinning out. </p>

								<h5>Username as identification</h5>
								<p>Currently, to transfer money to someone, the user has to have the receiver's phone number or NRIC. This creates a barrier to adoption for people without these two requirements, foreigners. While the foreign population may be the minority population in Singapore, this group is growing rather rapidly. To allow foreign travellers to integrate with Singapore's cashless society, there needs to be ways to enable them to adopt the revolutionised way of payment. <br><br>Using a unique username as a form of identity will allow this population to become new users. The app should also allow users to search for different usernames as they browse through a global catalog of usernames. <br> <br>
